# stabbed
stabbed is a very simple script invoking [suckless](https://suckless.org/) [tabbed](https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/) with [st](https://st.suckless.org/),
resulting in a terminal with tabs support built in.
<br>
Patches and custom configuration are provided to achieve the desired behavior.

## Requirements
In order to build both tabbed and st, you need the Xlib header files.
